	protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {}
	PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
	out.flush()
	protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {}
	Integer num1 = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter("number1"));get value
	draw tables in html
